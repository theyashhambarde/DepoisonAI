# DepoisonAI: Automated Detection and Reversal of Data Poisoning Attacks

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Proprietary-red.svg)](LICENSE)

DepoisonAI is a full-stack, production-ready AI system built from scratch to automatically detect and reverse data poisoning attacks in machine learning datasets. It leverages classical ML, deep learning, and statistical reasoning using only local, open-source tools.

## üéØ System Goals

- **Detect**: Identify if a dataset has been poisoned via label flipping, feature perturbation, or backdoors.
- **Identify**: Pinpoint the specific samples or features that have been compromised.
- **Reverse**: Clean the dataset by filtering malicious samples, relabeling incorrect data, or reconstructing perturbed features.
- **Evaluate**: Quantify the improvement in model performance after the cleaning process.
- **Visualize**: Provide clear visualizations of data distributions and identified poisoning patterns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features & Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+
- **ML/DL**: `scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`, `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`
- **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `t-SNE`
- **UI**: `Streamlit` (Optional Interface)
- **Local-First**: **No reliance on any commercial APIs or closed-source tools.** All models and computations run locally.

### Supported Attack Types
- **Tabular Data**: Label Flipping, Feature Perturbation.
- **Image Data**: Backdoor Attacks (e.g., trigger-based pixel patterns).
- **Text Data**: Label Flipping, Backdoor Attacks (e.g., trigger phrases).

### Detection & Cleaning Methods
- **Detection**: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest, PCA, Clustering, Saliency Maps, Embedding Analysis, TF-IDF Outlier Detection.
- **Cleaning**: Malicious Sample Filtering, k-NN Relabeling, Autoencoder-based Denoising, Masked Language Model Reconstruction.
